You are given an integer array `arr` of length `n` that represents a permutation of the integers in the range `[0, n - 1]`.

We split `arr` into some number of **chunks** (i.e., partitions), and individually sort each chunk. After concatenating them, the result should equal the sorted array.

Return _the largest number of chunks we can make to sort the array_.


**Example 1:**

``` Java
Input: arr = [4,3,2,1,0]
Output: 1
Explanation:
Splitting into two or more chunks will not return the required result.
For example, splitting into [4, 3], [2, 1, 0] will result in [3, 4, 0, 1, 2], which isn`t sorted.
```


**Example 2:**

``` Java
Input: arr = [1,0,2,3,4]
Output: 4
Explanation:
We can split into two chunks, such as [1, 0], [2, 3, 4].
However, splitting into [1, 0], [2], [3], [4] is the highest number of chunks possible.
```


**Constraints:**

-   `n == arr.length`
-   `1 <= n <= 10`
-   `0 <= arr[i] < n`
-   All the elements of `arr` are **unique**.
